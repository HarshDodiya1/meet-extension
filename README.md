# Meet Extension

Are you joining a meet call but don't want to be the first one to do so? If this describes you, we have the solution for you!

A Chrome extension for Google Meet that notifies users whenever a new member joins the meeting. This tool is particularly useful for teachers, team leaders, and anyone who needs to stay aware of participants joining a virtual meeting without constantly monitoring the participant list.

## Demo

## Features

- Real-time notifications when a new participant joins the meeting.
- Easy to install and use.
- Enhances productivity by allowing users to focus on the meeting content rather than monitoring attendees.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HarshDodiya1/meet-extension.git
    ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable 'Developer mode' by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click the 'Load unpacked' button and select the directory where you cloned the repository.

## Usage

1. After installing the extension, join a Google Meet meeting.
2. The extension will automatically start running and display notifications whenever a new participant joins the meeting.

## How it Works

The extension uses a content script to monitor the Google Meet participant list. When it detects a new participant, it triggers a notification to alert the user.
